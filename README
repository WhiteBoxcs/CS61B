Home setup of CS61B tools on Linux and MacOS.

1. PREREQUISITES
================

You must have the following software installed:

   A. Sun/Oracle Java version 8 as the default Java version.

   B. Python 3.

   C. (On Macs) the Xcode tools.  On Linux, the necessary tools are standard.

   D. Git

If these are in place and on your path, then the following commands should
all succeed:

    $ java -version
    # Should print something that begins 'java version "1.7....'

    $ python3 --version

    $ rsync --version

    $ git --version


2. SSH KEYS

To use the repository remotely, you'll need the private SSH key that
the repository account (cs61b-ta) is expecting from you.  The ssh
software keeps its information in a file called ~/.ssh.  This is a
hidden file (starts with a dot), which means that it is not ordinarily
listed by the 'ls' command.  However, you can try 'ls ~/.ssh' to see
if it's there.  I suggest the following procedure, executed ON YOUR
HOME MACHINE (do NOT do this on your instructional accoout):

   A. If you do not have a directory $HOME/.ssh, create one using, for 
      example,
          $ ssh cs61b@torus.cs.berkeley.edu
      (This will fail, but first will create a .ssh directory for you).

   B. Copy your private key from the instructional machines with:
          $ rsync -a LOGIN@torus.cs.berkeley.edu:.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa_cs61b
      replacing LOGIN with your login.

   C. Create the file .ssh/config (if you don't already have one) and add the
      line

      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_cs61b

   D. Test your setup by issuing the following on your home machine:

       $ ssh -n cs61b-ta@torus.cs.berkeley.edu

      After some messages, you should see something like

         hello <LOGIN>, this is cs61b-ta@torus running gitolite3 v3.6.3-11-g2417156 on git 1.7.12.1
         <bunch of stuff>

   E. [Optional] If you'd like to be able to use .ssh to log into your 
      instructional account from your home computer without the bother of
      a passphrase, you can so by executing the following command ON THE
      INSTRUCTIONAL SERVER (NOT on your home machine):

      $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

      (Yes, that is ">>", meaning "append", not ">", which would 
      mean "overwrite").  At this point, you should be able to log into 
      your instructional account from home with

         $  ssh LOGIN@ashby.cs.berkeley.edu

      (or some other server or workstation).

2. DOWNLOADS
============

Copy the contents of the home-setup directory from the instructional machines.

    git clone -b cs61b-software cs61b-ta@ashby.cs.berkeley.edu:shared cs61b-software

where LOGIN is your login on the instructional machines.

This will copy a directory called cs61b-software into your home
directory. It will contain subdirectories adm, bin, and lib, 
(and this README file).

4. EMACS

Add the following lines to your $HOME/.emacs file (creating that file if you
don't already have it) to use gjdb in Emacs:

(load-file "~/cs61b-software/adm/cs61b.el")

This will introduce the command M-x gjdb.  It will take effect the
next time you start Emacs.


5. PATH and CLASSPATH

5A. Unix and Mac
----------------

PATH and CLASSPATH are "environment variables" that are used to find
executable files and Java classes, respectively.  Their format is

   DIR1:DIR2:...:DIRn

where the DIRs are names of directories (or, for CLASSPATH, JAR (Java
Archive) files).  These variable are typically set in one or more of
the files .bashrc, .bash_profile, or .profile.  Unfortunately, there
has been divergence in practice.  The Debian Wiki (for one version of
Linux) contains a recommended procedure that has worked for many
years, but that the Ubuntu wiki "no longer recommends" for no
discernible reason (probably just one more result of open-source
software being in the hands of confounded amateurs).

I believe that the following strategy works in general to set both of
these.  In the file $HOME/.profile (or ~/.profile) include the
following line.  Also include it in your .bash_profile if you have one
(and it doesn't already read .profile).  The definitions should take
effect when you next log into your home machine:

source $HOME/cs61b-software/adm/login

5B. Windows
-----------

On Windows, you'll need to use the Environment Variables button on the Advanced
tab under Advanced System Settings, which you'll find in various places 
depending on what version of Windows you're running.  Once there, you'll want
to add a setting for CLASSPATH with value

    %USERPROFILE%\cs61b-software\lib\*;.

(that's a semicolon, not a colon).  If you already have a CLASSPATH value
(with other stuff than this on it) append 

    ;%USERPROFILE%\cs61b-software\lib\*

to it (being sure to include the semicolon as shown to separate it
from the stuff already there).  

Of course, if you have put cs61b-software somewhere other than in your home
directory (%USERPROFILE%), then make the appropriate modification to these
paths.

Finally, edit your PATH variable using the same technique you used for CLASSPATH
(Windpws calls it Path) to add our bin directory.  That is, append 

    ;%USERPROFILE%\cs61b-software\bin

to the end of your Path so that you will be able to run style61b and gjdb 
directly (again, modify appropriately if you've put the cs61b-software
directory in a "non-standard" location).

WARNING: paths and classpaths on pure Windows use a different convention from
   Unix.  The separator is ";" rather than ":", file names start with a
   device designator (like C:), and directories in a path entry use "\"
   rather than "/".  Git Bash on Windows uses the Unix convention
   for the PATH variable (":", "/", and "/c/" in place of "c:").  It can do
   this because the PATH is used to tell the shell where to find executable
   files, and the git bash shell understands Unix conventions.  Unfortunately,
   when you invoke java or javac via the bash shell, you still get the same
   java or javac program you'd get under pure windows, and those programs
   use the Windows conventions.  Hence the CLASSPATH must be in Windows
   format (";", "\", etc.), EVEN IF you set it in your .bash_profile.
