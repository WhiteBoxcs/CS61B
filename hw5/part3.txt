HW #5.

Question D.

1. Omega(x^2), O(x^2) => Theta(x^2)
By observation

2. Omega(log(x)), O(log(x)) => Theta(log(x))
By 7 and its complinment which were not proven.

3. f(N) in Theta(N^3) by
Sum i = j(j+1)/2
Sum j(jh+1)/2 = N(N+1)(N+2)/6
=> f(N) in theta(N).


4. a(N,M) in Theta(N + M)
j iterates to at most M once
i iterates to at most N once
thus the hypothesis.

5. Theta(n log n)
a_n = n + 2(n/2 + a_n/4)
    = n + n + a_n/4
    which happens log_2 n times
    thus
    f(n) in Theta n log n

6. Proof. We assume that there exists 
an x_1 such that f(x) > 1 for all x
more than x_1. Furthermore we assume that
x is monotonic. Take M to 
be the first x such that f(x) < f(x)^2.
Clearly M > x_1.
Then let K = 2ln(10)/ln(b).
Observe that when x > M
ln(f(x)) < 2 ln(f(x)) iff
ln(f(x))/ln(b) < K ln(f(x))/ln(10)
log_b f(x) < K log_10 f(x).

Therefore log_b(f(x)) in log_10(f(x)).



7. Proof. Simple! We assume that the polynomial
is not infinite. Take the highest degree term, cx^n. 
Then there exists a constant w for some x great enough
 log(f(x)) <= log(c*w*x^n)) iff
 log(f(x)) <= n*log(x)+ log(c*w)
 Then there exists a constant z for some x great enough
 c*nlog(x) >= n*log(x) + log(c*w)
 Therefore log(f(x)) in O(log(x)).


8. If f(n) is a postiive monotonicically non-decreasing function,
we have that f(n)/(upperf(n)) is non-decreasing since f' is non-negative. 
Take C = 2 inf f(n)/(upperf(n)) . Then it is clear that for all n upperf(n) < C f(n)
which implies that upperf(n) in O(f(n)). This completes the proof.
